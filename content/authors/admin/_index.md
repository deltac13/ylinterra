The Lin Lab at the University of Florida seeks to advance the understanding and application of soil health principles in the management of agricultural and natural ecosystems. Our research covers a wide range of topics including soil health assessment, organic matter persistence, remediation of legacy phosphorus, and nature-based solutions to climate change. We are a group of scientists who value diversity and inclusion and challenge each other in moving our science forward.
